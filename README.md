* In the Android Play Console from the homepage go to Settings > API Access

* Under the _Service Accounts_ Create a Service Account
* Edit the permission of the service account to link to your app
* From the Google Play Console select your App and from the left nav go to Store Presence -> In-App Production -> Subscriptions 
* Create a subscription (*NOTE* if you already have a subscription you must edit, update, and save in order for the above steps to take effect)
* Use the subscription Id, the base package name of your app, and the token generated by your app when subscribing to call Google's verification service from your server.
